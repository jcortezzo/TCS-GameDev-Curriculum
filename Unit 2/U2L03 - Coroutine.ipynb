    "When writing a complex code in Update function, or any function in general, the program will need to execute all of the code at once in a single frame. This mean, your game could potentially freeze and cause extreme headache to the player. With Coroutine however, we can execute the logic over multiple frames, which can help alleviate freeze up.\n",
