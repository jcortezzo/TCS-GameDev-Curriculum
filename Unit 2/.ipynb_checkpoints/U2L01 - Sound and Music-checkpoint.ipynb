    "reference. We can do that by calling `GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;()` on the GameObject that contain the AudioSource. \n",

    "#### **AudioSource.PlayOneShot(clip)**\n",
    "There is a second method called `PlayOneShot(clip)` with a parameter of an AudioClip. This method allows us to play multiple sound with a single AudioSource. This is good method to play multiple sfx at one. However, one disadvantage of this method is, all of the options such as volume, pitch, etc... will be the same for all sound being play with this method. Therefore, reconsider if using this method if sounds with difference settings is played."

    "# Concept 2: Jukebox (Audio Manager), Singleton pattern, Struct\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, we just learn how to add music, play on a loop, and some sfx sound for our character in our game. However, we can see that this approach do not give us a lot of control on when and how we should play our sounds and musics. When transitioning between scenes, we also notice music do not continue to play and get cut off. There are many ways to fix these problems, one approach we will show is the idea of an Audio Manager. Audio Manger will allow us to control when and how we want to play our sound/music. It will also help us with audio playing continuosly through different scenes. The structure of Audio Manager we will show you is simple and can be easily expand to handle more functionalities. Before writing the Audio Manager, there are a few programming concepts we want to introduce first. These are Singleton pattern and Struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Singleton Pattern**\n",
    "Singleton pattern is a software engineer design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to just <b>\"single\" instance</b>. In Unity layman's term, there should only be one single GameObject with this type in the scene. This can be very useful for our case since we can carry this single instance of JukeBox through multiple scenes, which allow for music to play continuously. Singleton pattern also allows for <b>easy global accessibility</b> which can be useful in a lot of contexts. Example in our case could be having our Player or Enemy class access the JukeBox without declaring a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note: Do not overuse this pattern design.</b> It is very tempting to making thing a singleton to have global accessibility, but this come with problem when your project grow! The bigger the project, the more complex your codebase become, which could be detrimental to your project continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few criteria before consider using singleton:\n",
    "- Instance of object must only exist once.\n",
    "- Must be accessible globaly.\n",
    "- Control concurrent access to data from multiple sources.\n",
    " \n",
    "More detail: [Wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Struct**\n",
    "\n",
    "Struct is very similar to a class, which can be think of as a data container. Data declared in struct are always public. Struct cannot be inherit, which mean inheritance is not allow. For our use, we can use struct to define a small data structure which contain useful information that is a sound (clip name, pitch, volume, etc...)\n",

The problem is PlayOneShot() will play the sound with the setting of the AudioSource, so when we play a different sfx, the old sfx will use the setting of the new sfx if it is still playing.\n",
