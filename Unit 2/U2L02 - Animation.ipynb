Usually, you want to change Pixels Per Unit to the value of the individual image's pixel size, however since the spritesheet is not consistence, we will not change this value until later. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Next click on \"Slice\". There are a few options we can choose to slice the images. For now we can just use \"Automatic\". After click on \"Slice\", we should see each image is now neatly separated. Click on \"Apply\" and close the \"Sprite Editor\" window.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcortezzo/TCS-GameDev-Curriculum/master/Unit%202/Images/U2L2_15\" alt=\"Drawing\"/>\n",

    "4. Let go back to Animation window, and change up our Animation Clip by update \"mario_idle\" with the sprite we just sliced up. First, click on the arrow button in \"mario_sprite\" again in the Sprite folder, then drag the idle frame into mario_idle timeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Few things we'll notice. First, the image is extremely small. Second, we have to do a lot of scaling to make the image larger. Third, our BoxCollider2D is now all messed up. There are a few ways to fix this problem. We will address it one by one.\n",

When create a FSM for our animation, we want to think about what kind of transition is possible and also think about if those transitions are necessary. If we have too many transitions, remember that it would only make our life more miserable.  \n",

    "10. Next in order for us to have some meaningful way to transition between states, we need to set up some conditions. For idleling to moving, it makes sense to have condition based on speed.

    "\n",
    "10. Almost there, this is the last step! We have mostly everything set up, the last thing to do is connect these values and animation transition into our code. First, let create a new script to handle animation. I will call this script \"MarioAnimation\" for now. \n",
