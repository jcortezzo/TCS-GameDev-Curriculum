    "## Lives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a public variable \"lives\" to the mario_lives script. Set it equal to 5 to start.\n",
    "1. Replace the Debug.Log in the mario_lives script with code that will decrease the number of lives by 1 and kill (deactivate) Mario UNLESS Mario jumps on top of the goomba. If Mario lands on top of the goomba, the goomba should die (by deactivating).\n",
    "  * Hint: To check if Mario is on top of the goomba, check if the lowest point on Mario is above or at the same level as the highest point of the goomba using the collider's bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mario can also lose lives in other ways. For example, if he falls through the hole in the middle of the scene. We can check for that by looking at the y-value of Mario's transform.position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an empty GameObject called worldScripts. We'll need this to control what happens when Mario (or another character) dies.\n",
    "  * Since this GameObject is empty, it won't show up or otherwise interfere with your game. However, it is necessary to reactivate Mario once he's been deactivated. It's also very useful for connecting different objects in your scene and later passing information between levels.\n",
    "1. Create a script that checks if Mario's y position is low enough that he is off screen. If he is, Mario should lose a life and be deactivated. Any power-ups should also be canceled out.\n",
    "1. This same script should also check if Mario is deactivated. It should move Mario back to the initial starting position and reactivate him if he still has lives left. If Mario has no more lives, print a message to the console stating, \"Game Over. You have no more lives left.\" and stop the game.\n",
    "  * Hint: Use [Time.timeScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-timeScale.html) to stop the game. To get the desired behavior, also make sure that your goomba walking script has a Time.deltaTime multiplied into the speed and the script on the worldScripts object uses FixedUpdate() instead of Update().\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that while not shown in the video, the goomba should stop moving when the game stops — that should be covered by multiplying by Time.deltaTime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mario_lives script should end up looking something like this. I've used the [collider's bounds](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/Bounds.html) to figure out what the top and bottom most values for the goomba and Mario, respectively, and compared those to figure out if the goomba should die or if Mario should lose a life."
