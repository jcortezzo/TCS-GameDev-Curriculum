    "### **Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language. This means that in C#, we work with **objects** that contain data. An object can be one of many different **data types**. The following are some the most common data types in C#:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **char**: a character (e.g., 'a', '3', ' ', '!')\n",
    "*   **string**: a sequence of characters, forming a word or phrase (e.g., \"house\", \"Hello world!\")\n",
    "*   **int**: an integer (e.g., 32, 0, -120)\n",
    "*   **double**: a decimal number (e.g., 1.0, 10.546, -0.00001)\n",
    "*   **float**: also a decimal number, but stored differently in memory and denoted with a small 'f' (e.g., 1.0f, 10.546f, -0.00001f)\n",
    "*   **bool**: a Boolean, which is a value that is either *true* or *false*\n",
    "\n",
    "When we type these values in code, we refer to them as **literals**. A literal for a char is surrounded by single quotation marks (e.g., 'a'). A literal for a string is surrounded by double quotation marks (e.g., \"word\"). int and double literals are written just as numbers, and float literals are written as numbers with a small 'f' at the end (e.g., 10.546f). Boolean literals are written as the keywords true and false.\n",
