Start and pause menus are examples of UI elements, but UI's can also extend to health indicators, point counters, and other potentially interactive and informative displays. In this lesson, we'll learn Unity's basic UI capabilities by creating a start menu for our game."

    "The goal of the start menu is to present users with the title of the game and a button to allow users to start the game. We'll start this lesson by creating the background and header for our start menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough: Adding the Background Image\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   First, create a new scene for our start menu by clicking File > New Scene. This will open up your new empty scene. Save the scene by clicking File > Save As and change the name to MenuScene. It is strongly recommended, if you haven't done so already, to create a Scenes folder in your Assets folder. Click and drag your new scene from the Assets folder into the Scenes folder in the Project hierarchy at the bottom left.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1R-_u9qHBRDSgye3SEZ6s0-RfKgGTkjTd)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Now we'll create the object for our background image. In the top left corner of the Game Hierarchy on the left, click Create > UI > Image. This will create a few objects, which you'll see appear in the Game Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Canvas** is the parent object for all UI elements in a scene. It is automatically added when you add your first UI object to your scene, and any UI object you add after that will be added as a child of the **Canvas**. You'll likely need to zoom way out in your scene view to see the canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Parenting is an important concept in Unity that we haven't learned yet. We'll learn about it later, but basically any transformations applied to a parent object are automatically applied to that object's child objects. The reverse does not apply. So, any changes made to the Canvas will affect all UI elements in the scene.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Image** object is the object you just created, and it's added as a child of the **Canvas**. The Image object comes with three components. The first is the *Rect Transform* component. This is a replacement for the *Transform* component we've seen on all our other objects so far. It gives us transformational control specific to UI Images. The *Canvas Renderer* component renders the Image on the Canvas, i.e. it makes the Image visible. The *Image* component is a script that allows you to customize your image. We'll add our image in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EventSystem** object processes and routes input events from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   Rename the Image to Background and set the *Pos X* and *Pos Y* properties of the Image object's Rect Transform component to 0, centering the Image on the Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZIYaB2a-cKDen2WDbfLEjOy5bQCj4UIJ)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   Add an image for your Background object to display by clicking and dragging an image from your Assets folder to the Source Image property of the Image component. You can use the bricks image in the Unit 1 Assets folder or any other image. It's best to stick with a rectangular image for the background. Then, click *Set Native Size* in the Image component of the Background object to resize the sprite to its source image's original dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1l7GFsp6WLuvlJp9qrp26WVuH02sQtJ_-)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.   The image will still most likely look too big or too small in the scene. Furthermore, the image's size will vary greatly across devices with different screen sizes. To control this, we'll need to use a few different components. First, select the Canvas object and look at the *Canvas Scaler* component. The *UI Scale Mode* property has three options. *Constant Pixel Size* sets images to be the same size in pixels regardless of the screen size. A phone screen, for example, has far less pixels than a computer screen, so canvases with this mode selected will display images that appear to be far larger on smaller screens than on bigger screens. *Scale With Screen Size* allows us to designate a reference resolution with respect to which the Canvas will scale its images. *Constant Physical Size* allows us to control the physical size of the Canvas' image in millimeters or other units. We want the *Scale With Screen Size*. Select this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, change the *Reference Resolution* to match the image's native size. You can find this native size in the *Rect Transform* property of the Background object: they're the *Width* and *Height* properties. Play with the *Match* slider in the *Canvas Scaler* component to change how the image fills the Canvas if the aspect ratio of the image doesn't match that of the Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19KEEZmXAl87QZ4IxbtiJ7F4IQYXgv1J3)\n",
    "\n",
    "6.   The Canvas Scaler gets us the correct size for our image with respect to the Canvas, but there are still issues with the aspect ratio. Navigate to the Game tab and view the scene in different screen aspect ratios by selecting *Free Aspect* below the Game tab. Any time you see blue margins, that means that the background image isn't filling the whole screen. To fix this, select the Background object and add a new component called *Aspect Ratio Fitter*. Change the *Aspect Mode* property to *Envelope Parent*. This will fit the background image to any aspect ratio.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough: Adding the Background Image\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   First, we'll add the Button object to our scene. Create a Button object by selecting Create > UI > Button. A Button object is simply an Image with a Button script component and a child Text object. The Button comes with the child Text object by default, but the Text object is not required; you can delete it if you want. We'll leave it for now. Rename the new Button object to StartButton.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Play with the Rect Transform property values to position the button on your Canvas. The Bottom Stretch anchor will stretch the button horizontally across different aspect ratios. This anchor substitutes the Pos X property with Left and Right properties, which allow you to set the distance between each side of the button and each side of the Canvas.\n",

    "\n",
    "4.   Now we need to make the button transition us from the menu scene to the game scene. First, we need to add all of the scenes in our game to the build. Click File > Build Settings to open the Build Settings menu. Then, select the Scenes folder in the Game Hierarchy in the bottom left, and click and drag all the scenes you want in your game from the Scenes folder into the Scenes In Build section of the Build Settings menu. In this case, you should add the current menu scene and another scene from an earlier lesson to transition to.

This property allows us to select a function from any script that we write that will be executed any time the button is clicked. The only requirement is that the function must be in a script that is attached to an object in our scene. We'll write a function that changes the scene from the menu scene to the game scene. First, however, we need to add an object to hold the script in which we write this function. Let's add an empty object by selecting Create > Create Empty. Rename this new object UIManager, create a new script by clicking Add Component > New Script, and name the new script UIManager.\n",
