    "2.   Let's add all of the scenes in our game to the Scenes In Build section. You can do so by navigating to the Scenes folder in the Game Hierarchy in the bottom left and clicking and dragging all of your game's scenes into the Scenes In Build section of the Build Settings menu. If there are scenes in the Scenes In Build section that you don't want to include in your build, you should uncheck them to save space. You'll also want to make sure your Start Menu is the first scene of your game. Rearrange your scene order by clicking and dragging the listed scenes in the Scenes In Build section. Rearrange your scenes so that the Start Menu scene has a number 0 all the way to the righthand side of the Scenes In Build section.\n",

    "3.   In the Platform section of the Build Settings menu, notice the many available platforms for which you can build your game. Most of the platforms require extra steps or different Unity licenses, so we'll build our game for PC, Mac & Linux Standalone. Select this option in the Platform section. Also, select the Target Platform that matches the computer on which you are developing.\n",

    "4.   Finally, click Build and select the folder in which you want to save your build. It's good practice to make multiple builds throughout the development of your game. Many developers make a folder in their Unity project directory called Builds and name each build after the date of build.\n",
